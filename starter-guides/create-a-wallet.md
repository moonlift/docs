# Create a wallet

The first thing you want to find out before picking your wallet, is the network you want to be on. We currently have **two** compatible networks. These are Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\) and Ethereum's Polygon Network. There are no significant pros and cons to the networks. Picking your network **will** have consequences in-game. 

In the near future visuals will change in some functions depending on your network. Besides, since Origon and Nimble are our rewardtokens, you will be rewarded Origon when connected via Polygon and Nimble when connected via Binance Smart Chain. For some games it's even an indicator for what type of loot you can obtain. Don't worry, we'll make sure everything is as balanced as possible but there are going to be minor differences.

The first things you should want to know when creating a wallet are;

* Only download the **latest** version from the **official** source.
* Keep your recovery phrases in a safe place.
* Have patience walking through the set up since most of it is noteworthy.
* **Do not** share your recovery phrases with anyone.
* **Do not** enter your recovery phrases on an online platform other than your wallet. Recommended is to write them on a piece of paper and safely store it.
