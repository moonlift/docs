# Create a wallet

The first thing you want to find out before picking your wallet, is the network you want to be on. We currently have **two** compatible networks on our decentralized exchange. These are Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\) and Ethereum's Polygon Network. There are no significant pro's and con's to the networks. Picking your network **will** have consequences on our decentralized exchange though.
