# Governance

### Introduction

Governance rules the game. Chain Wars makes governance a high priority because we aspire to create a user driven universe with an unique ecosystem that's powered by the player. We want to decentralize governance to a large extend. This is a process that must be approached with patience. This threads topics are the utility of governance, votepower and future plans.

### Utility

So, what's the point of governance in Chain Wars? All establishing models for the game will be tweaked as the circumstances of the game will change and evolve. For this tweaking, Chain Wars aspires a democratic system running in the background to make fair and square decisions and assert our visions of player participation and right of say. Currently, these models are;

* Gameplay
* Gamedesigns
* Token Models
* Reward Models
* Treasury Management
