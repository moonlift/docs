# Chain Wars Essence \(CWE\)

Chain Wars Token \(CWE\) is the bridge between community and game. It allows players to codirect the flow of the game. Meanwhile it's a requirement for playing the game.

|  | Governance | NFT | Rewards | Lootbox \(~5 USD each\) | Season Pass \(~5 USD each\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User** | Hold for governance / Hold to play | Spend for NFT | Play | Buy with CWE | Buy with CWE |
| **Season Prizes** | ➖ | 0.25% | ➖ | 25% per sold unit | 75% per sold unit |
| **Treasury** | ➖ | 4% | ➖ | 75% per sold unit | 25% per sold unit |

These usecases create a dynamic in which the player is centivized to hold CWE, because with more CWE you have more voting power \(governance\) and possibilities within the game. With these possibilties you can amplify your Play to Earn experience. Find more information about these subjects in the subthreads.
