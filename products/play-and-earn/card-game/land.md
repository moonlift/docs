Owners of land can fill their plot with structures and decorations which cost resources to create. Some structures have a connection with features on the decentralized exchange. Other structures can improve your ability of playing the core game. For example, you can get small advantages in obtaining better cards from lootboxes or better odds of getting rare cards from Forging.
