# Utility and Sustainability

## Summary

In this sheet we will describe the utility and sustainability of each token, in the context of Card Game. We will elaborate on considered decisions and hope to inform you about the dynamic.

### MLTPX

Owning MLTPX allows participants to 'voice' in ongoing discussions. These discussions can concern a wide variety of issues such as future updates, problems/bugs and voting for contests/events.

### Nimble/Origon

Utility of Nimble and Origon consists mostly out of the usecases in-game. These are;

* Buying Land
* Buying Lootboxes
* Buying a Season Pass
* Forging Cards

To manage sustainability of Nimble and Origon, the required amount to forge cards or buy a season pass will burn 100%. Land will be traded in an open peer to peer market \(the community determines the price\).
