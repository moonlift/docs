# Forging

## Summary

Forging allows players to convert duplicate or non-used cards and resources into superior cards with the possibility of having unique traits. This merging of cards has systemized odds of gaining rare or not so rare cards. Some circumstances \(such as events or certain structures\) can boost these odds. We will elaborate on the details.

### What is Forging?

With Forging you can merge 2 up to 5 different cards. The types of cards you choose for Forging determine the possible outcome. In order to consciently Forge, you need to know what types of cards there are. Cards are seperated by 3 factors;

* Species
* Rarity
* Form

Species correlates to the network you're connected with. Moonlift is neutral in the ongoing war between Nimble and Origon. This means Moonlift cards can be played on both sides.
