# ChainWars

## Introduction

We are extremely excited to be working on a blockchaingame since it's still a very unique opportunity. In ChainWars, we can utilize all creativity we and the community have to offer! We can showcase art in any form \(with the possibility to tokenize it\), direct the flow of the story and make crypto an interactive and possibly more understandable experience.

In abstract, we wish to use the technical possibilities blockchain provides to make a fun game in which the player is the one and only owner of his/her earnings.

## Story

ChainWars evolves around a story of galactic warfare. The essence of the galaxy, SuperNova, has been destroyed after millenia of conflict. Dark years have passed, planets and inhabitants have suffered and resources are scarce. It's up to the survivors to recharge the SuperNova and revive the galaxy!

## Gameplay

The main game is a strategic card-game. The cards are created by our very own designers and made compatible by our game- and blockchaindevelopers. The main goal of the game is getting a strong, diverse deck of cards so you can compete with the best players of the game. For detailed information and a quick guide, see **LINK.**

Land will be the supportive secondairy gamemode. Land is essentially a planet divided into lots of plots of building space. Players can upgrade their deck, personalize their character and piece of land and socialize with other players. It also functions as a way to level up to avoid matchmaking issues.

You are the one and only owner of your rewards so you choose how to utilize them.

Rewards all have their own usecases. Most of them come down to upgrading your deck/cards, but you can also decide to trade with some of them. We want to emphasize the importance of this, because in mainstream games all currency and effort you put in is eventually lost since it's not your true property.
