# ChainWars

## Introduction

We are extremely excited to be working on a blockchaingame since it's still a very unique opportunity. In ChainWars, we can utilize all creativity we and the community have to offer! We can showcase art in any form \(with the possibility to tokenize it\), direct the flow of the story and make crypto an interactive and possibly more understandable experience.

In abstract, we wish to use the technical possibilities blockchain provides to make a fun game in which the player is the one and only owner of his/her earnings.

## Story

ChainWars evolves around a story of galactic warfare. The essence of the galaxy, SuperNova, has been destroyed after millenia of conflict. Dark years have passed, planets and inhabitants have suffered and resources are scarce. It's up to the survivors to recharge the SuperNova and revive the galaxy!

## Gameplay

There are 2 main gamemodes for progressing and leveling up.
