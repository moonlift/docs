## Rewards & Earnings

### Lootboxes

These will be for sale on the NFT-marketplace and obtainable via the completion of all weekly quests. Events will provide even more ways to obtain lootboxes.

### Season prizes

We will allocate 10% of mint per block for Nimble and Origon to be awarded as auto-injection to the top 20 players. 1.325 x 30 = 39.750 is the share of daily emission to be distributed amongst the top 20. 

| Rank | Percentage of share \(%\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Number 1 | 10 % + Season Winner Emblem |
| Number 2 - 3 | 7.5 % + Season Winner Emblem |
| Number 4 - 5 | 5 % + Season Winner Emblem |
| Number 6 - 10 | 5 % |
| Number 11 - 20 | 4 % |

### Reward per Win

For each win, you get suitable rewards. These depend on your current level and skill \(the latter is measured with the division you're playing in\).

### Daily Quests

These will contain three preset quests, centivizing players to spend a small amount of time each day playing the game. This will result in faster queues and stronger decks. The preset daily quests;

* Daily Check-In.
* Play 5 games.
* Win 3 games.

### Weekly Quests

You can also obtain rewards on weekly basis by completing weekly quests. These quests will differ but come down to playing certain cards, playing/winning an x amount of games or minor quests related to the decentralized exchange.
