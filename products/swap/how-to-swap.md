# How to Swap

As far as 'easy' goes in crypto, swapping on our decentralized exchange is relatively easy compared to most other exchanges. Charts, orderbooks and other data can be overwhelming for some people, especially new traders. We offer you a clear, straightforward swap with built-in fee calculations.

### Getting Started

To kick things off, you will need your own crypto wallet with some BEP-20 or ERC-20 tokens. The wallet needs to be compatible. Next, you need to connect your wallet. To accomplish all these things we have a seperate starters guide. Make sure to check it out [here](../../starter-guides/).
