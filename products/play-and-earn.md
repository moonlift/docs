# üéÆ Play & Earn

Play & Earn

Ever watched someone earn by streaming their gaming adventures and wondered whether there was a way you could earn by playing games, too? The MoonLift Core Team is proud to announce that we‚Äôre collaborating with Wise Minds Software Development to create ‚ÄúPlay and Earn‚Äù, a new community-driven gaming platform that will feature our own games with intrinsic reward programs.

MoonLift has chosen to focus on high amounts of user participation as a core tenet of its strategy. On the gaming platform, user participation will be ensured by means of ease of access. This means that no requirements will be in place, since games will also offer a free-to-play mode.

Nonetheless, multiple games and modes will allow for reward-based ‚ÄúPlay and Earn‚Äù so that there will be options to play with high stakes and high rewards for the more risk-friendly players.

Games will be fast-paced, competitive, skill-based and with an element of luck. Both multi-platform and single-platform games will be available and, in most cases, multiplayer will be fundamental: different modalities will be featured, varying from cooperative games to free for all games, so that all player types may find their preferred gaming experience.

When it comes to the arts, ‚ÄúPlay and Earn‚Äù will maintain a homing and familiar cartoonish style across all games. For this reason, we will employ the crypto gateway and the existing Moonlift designs.

In addition, not only will you be able to use your NFTs as in-game cosmetics, but through our innovative achievement-system you will even be able to obtain NFTs as rewards for great feats!

Achievements will be unlocked both through game-related tasks, such as in-game performance, and dex-related goals, such as staking their MLTP over a certain period of time.

Clearly, a lot of developments to process and look forward to! We hope you are just as excited as we are about the future of Moonlift. Make sure to stay updated to our socials for more details and eventually, release dates! And as always, thank you for your sustained support.

Cordially,

The MoonLift Protocol Core Team
