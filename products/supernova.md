**Dear MoonLifters,**   


We are ecstatic to inform you that we are working on the release of an important new development that has been in the making for some time now: we are about to launch the SUPERNOVA pool, a single-stake, singe-pool feature that will grant individuals the chance to earn further thanks to their MLTPX possessions.  


Through the participation of and partnership with third-party crypto projects, SUPERNOVA will offer the MoonLift community the chance to farm external projectsâ€™ tokens by simply staking their MLTPX in the SUPERNOVA pool.   


Naturally, external tokens will undergo a manual quality scrutiny, to ensure that the community is provided only with the best farming opportunities.  
Individuals who stake their MLTPX in SUPERNOVA will be rewarded with all the tokens from those third party projects that have been admitted to SUPERNOVA by the MoonLift Protocol Core Team.   


It is going to be possible to lock your MLTPX in SUPERNOVA for 14, 30, 60 or 90 days in order to get extra benefits depending on the length of time involved.   


As always, we want to thank you for the continued support over the course of this adventure. This is only the first of many further developments, so stay tuned.
